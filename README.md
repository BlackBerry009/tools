## About
this is project is to learn Next.js and use some popular library

**Next.js + shadcn ui + tailwind css + swr**

## Conclusion
shadcn ui is so so so difficult to use because it is very flexible. i need to wrap it for some components.

therefore, i have to use antd to replace it

ant5 use css-in-js feature. so i can custom the theme aimed at shadcn ui

that's all.
