## About
this project is to learn Next.js and use some popular library

**Next.js + shadcn ui + tailwind css + swr**

## Conclusion
> shadcn ui is so difficult to use because it is very flexible. I need to wrap it up for some components.
> therefore, I have to use antd to replace it
> antd5 use css-in-js feature. so I can customize the theme and aim at shadcn ui

> swr with antd don't work well together, should be combined with ahooks

That's all
